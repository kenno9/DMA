"""
    SelectionSort compares to our previous algorithm.

    Our previous algorithm has two loops and so has SelectionSort.
    Our previous algorithm runs in O(n^2) time and so does SelectionSort.

    Our algorithm stores a value and iterates through the list to find a nil value
    at the end. Then it places the stored value there.

    SelectionSort iterates through the list to find the lowest value, then it 
    stores this value and places it at the start of the list.
